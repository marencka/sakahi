COMP 426 - Web Programming : Final Project

COMP 426 - Web Programming Final Project. This is a theoretical homepage for fellow UNC students with a firebase login, three different API calls, a made-from-scratch tic-tac-toe game, and mobile-friendly CSS. The UNC homepage for students is called "Sakai", thus the tongue-in-cheek renaming.

Thank you for viewing!
